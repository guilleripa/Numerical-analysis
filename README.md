# Numerical-analysis
## Euler Method
> Euler method (also called forward Euler method) is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. It is the most basic explicit method for numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and is the simplest Runge–Kutta method.
## Hermite Interpolation
> Hermite Interpolation is a method of interpolating data points as a polynomial function. The generated Hermite interpolating polynomial is closely related to the Newton polynomial, in that both are derived from the calculation of divided differences.
## Lagrange Interpolation
> Lagrange polynomials are used for polynomial interpolation. See [Wikipeida]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial}
## Newton's Interpolation
> Newton's divided differences is an algorithm, historically used for computing tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions. Divided differences is a recursive division process. The method can be used to calculate the coefficients in the interpolation polynomial in the Newton form.
## Newton–Cotes Method
> Newton–Cotes formulae, also called the Newton–Cotes quadrature rules or simply Newton–Cotes rules, are a group of formulae for numerical integration (also called quadrature) based on evaluating the integrand at equally spaced points. They are named after Isaac Newton and Roger Cotes.
## Predictor–Corrector Method
> Predictor–Corrector methods belong to a class of algorithms designed to integrate ordinary differential equations – to find an unknown function that satisfies a given differential equation. All such algorithms proceed in two steps:
> 1. The initial, "prediction" step, starts from a function fitted to the function-values and derivative-values at a preceding set of points to extrapolate ("anticipate") this function's value at a subsequent, new point.
> 2. The next, "corrector" step refines the initial approximation by using the predicted value of the function and another method to interpolate that unknown function's value at the same subsequent point.
## Trapizoidal method
> Trapezoidal rule is a technique for approximating the definite integral. The trapezoidal rule works by approximating the region under the graph of the function f(x) as a trapezoid and calculating its area. hat
