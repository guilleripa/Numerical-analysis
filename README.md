## Euler Method
> Euler method (also called forward Euler method) is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with a given initial value. It is the most basic explicit method for numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and is the simplest Rungeâ€“Kutta method.
## Hermite Interpolation
> Hermite Interpolation is a method of interpolating data points as a polynomial function. The generated Hermite interpolating polynomial is closely related to the Newton polynomial, in that both are derived from the calculation of divided differences.
